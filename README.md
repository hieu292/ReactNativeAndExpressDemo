<h1> Simple To Do Task App <h1>

In this app, I created a Back-end with ExpressJS (NodeJS), Mongoose (MongoDB) and Socket.IO. In Back-end, I built some APIs (RESTful methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

In Front-end, I used React Native to create a cross-platform mobile app. It make requests to Back-end and take JSON responses.

**Some Result**

Create Task:

![create task](https://github.com/hieu292/ReactNativeAndExpressDemo/blob/master/images/createTask.PNG)
![Alert create task successfully](https://github.com/hieu292/ReactNativeAndExpressDemo/blob/master/images/returnPostCreateTask.PNG)
![Result create task](https://github.com/hieu292/ReactNativeAndExpressDemo/blob/master/images/resultCreateTask.PNG)

Delete Task (touch to delete)

![delete task](https://github.com/hieu292/ReactNativeAndExpressDemo/blob/master/images/deleteTask.PNG)
![Result delete task](https://github.com/hieu292/ReactNativeAndExpressDemo/blob/master/images/resultDeleteTask.PNG)



**How to run it**

After you download it.
1. In Back-end folder (ExpressServer) you run "npm install". After that, you run "node server.js". (Remember you must run MongoDB in local first).

2. In Front-end folder (ReactNativeClient) you also run "npm install". After that, you run "react-native run" and "react-native run-android". Sorry, my machine run on Windows, so I didn't test IOS.

Ok that it. If you have any trouble, feel free to ask me at hieuwebdeveloper@gmail.com.
