<h1> Simple To Do Task App <h1>
<p>In this app, I created a Back-end with ExpressJS (NodeJS), Mongoose (MongoDB) and Socket.IO. In Back-end, I built some APIs (RESTful methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). </p>
<p> In Front-end, I used React Native to create a cross-platform mobile app. It make requests to Back-end and take JSON responses. </p>
**Some Result**

**How to run it**
<p>After you download it.</p>
1. In Back-end folder (ExpressServer) you run "npm install". After that, you run "node server.js". (Remember you must run MongoDB in local first).

2. In Front-end folder (ReactNativeClient) you also run "npm install". After that, you run "react-native run" and "react-native run-android". Sorry, my machine run on Windows, so I didn't test IOS.

Ok that it. If you have any trouble, feel free to ask me at hieuwebdeveloper@gmail.com.
